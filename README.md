# NurseAssistant

# Inspiration
#Wouldn't it be great to have easy, digital access to your patient's medical records?

# What it does
#NurseAssistant is an app that allows you to enter the patient's name, age, height, weight, cholesterol level, and blood pressure, and displays the information in a table. NurseAssistant also interprets your patient's cholesterol level and blood pressure and presents the warning values (ie. high cholesterol) as colored values in the table. NurseAssistant will also let you know when you've entered an unexpected value.
